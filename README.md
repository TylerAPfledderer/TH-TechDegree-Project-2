# TH-TechDegree-Project-2
 Mobile-First Responsive Layout Project for the FEWD TechDegree on TreeHouse

This project focuses on laying out a website from mobile screens on up, using CSS and HTML only. The markup is built from scratch and based on three images of approximate design results at differnt media queries (images can be found in the "mockups" folder). Some stylings and content have been altered.
